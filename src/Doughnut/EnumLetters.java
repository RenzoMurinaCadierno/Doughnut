 * Disclaimer:
 * 
 * Before writing the very first line of this whole app, my intention was 
 * to make it open source, so you can use it in any way you wish. 
 * 
 * But please, it would be much appreciated if you could give the
 * credits to the author and the links of contact and of download to the
 * original work, as I'm trying my best to be acknowledged to safely drop
 * the not-life-fulfilling job I'm currently at, and finally dedicate my
 * life to my true passion: coding apps and applets.
 * 
 * Additional commentary:
 * 
 * The code in this class was written by hand, and that is why the GUI's 
 * aesthetic is not at all appealing.
 * I did it this as a practical exercise to understand how a JForm is 
 * created from scratch and give it my best shot, since this whole 
 * project is my first attempt at coding in Java and at OOP.
 * I'm new to programming. I have been studying Java, Javascript and Python
 * (and some of its frameworks) for half a year since this date.
